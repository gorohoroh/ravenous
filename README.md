### About

This is just a React-based practice project that's part of Codecademy's [Build Front-End Web Apps](http://pro.codecademy.com/intensive/build-frontend-webapps-from-scratch/) Pro Intensive course. I'm taking the course as a challenge to get a better feel for JavaScript (I hated it based on prior encounters), and I'm doing well so far.

### Backlog
* Make addresses clickable and have them open the address in Google Maps in a new tab
* Make images clickable and have them open the business' website in a new tab
* Clicking on a different sorting option automatically requeries the Yelp API, rather than having to manually click "Let's Go" again
* Implement your own type of sort (for example, by entering a distance or radius from a central location)
* :white_check_mark: Allow you to search by pressing "Enter" (or "Return") on your keyboard, as opposed to manually clicking
* Add autocompletion of addresses to the "Location" input
* Cover with tests
* Display progress while search is ongoing
* Try flushing businesses one-by-one
* Include search criteria into URL
