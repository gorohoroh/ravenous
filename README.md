### About

This is just a React-based practice project that's part of Codecademy's [Build Front-End Web Apps](http://pro.codecademy.com/intensive/build-frontend-webapps-from-scratch/) Pro Intensive course. I'm taking the course as a challenge to get a better feel for JavaScript (I hated it based on prior encounters), and I'm doing well so far.
